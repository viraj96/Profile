1.  <h3><b>Calculator</b></h3> <p>This is a simple web app calculator built using Javascript and was created by me in order to better understand Javascript.
                  It was created originally on codepen.</p>

2. <h3><b>RQG aka Random Quote Generator</b></h3> <p>This was the first web app created by me in my bid to understand Javascript as a newbie.
                                              This was also created on codepen.</p>

3.  <h3><b>Timer</b></h3> <p>This is till now my last attempt at understanding Javascript and jQuery. It was one of the most difficult task that I carry out.
              Developing this made me understand the intricacies of Javascript. Also, was created on codepen.</p>

4.  <h3><b>Sudoku Solver</b></h3> <p>I am quite intrigued by sudokus and can't resist myself when I find new sudoku puzzles to solve. So, I decided to make 
                      program to make my life easier. Hence this was created. You can simply download the file and run it in terminal just like any 
                      cpp file. Keep in mind that the input file with the code contains a puzzle of the level EVIL. So, inorder to test it keep
                      making changes to the input file by introducing even FIENDISH level puzzles.</p>

5.  <h3><b>Ashphalt Retrofied (C++ Game) </b></h3> <p>I am currently making a C++ game that is somewhat similar to asphalt but with not-so-good graphics. It is something I wanted to make since school but could not find any easy-to-use 2D graphics api for C++, but recently I found QuickCG. This is going to be updated almost everyday. Now, you can play by simply using make command in terminal.If that does not work then use `g++ *.cpp -lSDL -O3`. For those who do not have SDL library, can install it using `sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev`. Happy playing!! Any issues and suggestions are welcome.</p>
